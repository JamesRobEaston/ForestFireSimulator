# ForestFireSimulator
This is a small project to develop my skills with python. This program takes in a density of the forest and a chance that the fire will
catch and spread and uses this information to simulate a forest fire. This program comes with a console-based display, but a GUI-based application could be developed or this could be used as a without a display and as a back-end to collect data.
